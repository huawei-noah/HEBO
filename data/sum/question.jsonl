One is a GMC and the other is a Chevrolet, but they are mechanically identical. CONVOY: Scooby-one and Scooby-two took up positions in Hillary's motorcade on a freeway near Des Moines. BACK SEAT DRIVER? Hillary Clinton climbs into the so-called Scooby van after a campaign stop at Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa. Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday. It\u2019s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan. Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate\u2019s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade. UNDER GUARD: Two Secret Service agents with Scooby One in Iowa today. MOTORCADE: The Clinton convoy includes both Scooby vans and four black Suburbans, believed to all be Secret Service vehicles. It also included a white minivan on Wednesday. Scooby-Two\u2019s driver brought up the rear, at enough of a distance to allow another car to pull in front of him. When that car stopped at a red light, the GMC van\u2019s blue and red flashing lights came on. The stray car\u2019s driver pulled to one side and Scooby-Two zoomed into the intersection, against the light.

Conversations between the Australian High Commission in New Delhi and Government officials in Canberra detail how the couple travelled to India in late 2012 and seeked citizenship for a baby girl but told consular staff they would be leaving her twin brother behind because they could not afford him. The couple reportedly told staff they wanted a baby girl to 'complete their family'. The Australian man told consulate staff he would be giving the boy to some friends in India 'who were unable to conceive a child', according to the report. The couple was told the boy would be left stateless if they followed through on plans to abandon him, because India does not recognise surrogate children as citizens. Documents reveal the shocking details of the case that saw a couple return to Australia with a baby girl while leaving her twin brother behind. 'If the parents do not apply for Australian citizenship for the child, the child will be stateless in India... our ability to provide assistance to a non Australian citizen is limited,' a DFAT email in December, 2012 said. There were also fears last year that the boy may have been sold. Chief Justice of the Family Court, Diana Bryant, said  consular staff had told her of their concerns.

But the one-year-old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother Maggie at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend. Maggie, 53, who has already raised one surrogate child, has proved herself yet again by helping to raise Kecil (pronounced Ka-cheel) for the past 10 months, and the two now have an inseparable bond. Scroll down for video. Taking care: Maggie, 53, wraps a protective arm around Kecil the baby orangutan who she has been raising for the past ten months after his mother and a surrogate mother both rejected him. Inseparable: Zookeepers were nervous that Maggie might reject Kecil after raising four of her own children and another surrogate which was given to her in 2002, but she has proved her parenting prowess once again. When the pair appeared in front of news crews earlier today, Kecil began crying after losing sight of Maggie for a few moments. But the elder orangutan quickly returned, at which point Kecil quietened down and scooted over to join her, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at\u00a0Toledo zoo, in Ohio, 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth. He was moved to\u00a0Milwaukee County Zoo and given to a second surrogate, but she did not form a bond with him either. In a final attempt to find a parent for Kecil, he was handed over to Maggie, the oldest orangutan in North America, who has already raised four children of her own, and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002. The pair immediately showed signs of intimacy, but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties. Nava Greenblatt, one of the zoo\u2019s lead primate keepers, said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago, frightening Kecil, who ran to Maggie and cuddle up to her. Turning point: Keepers in Chicago said the turning point for Kecil came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo, frightening him. Usually he turned to people for comfort, but instead he ran and cuddled up to Maggie. Big day: After settling into his new enclosure, Kecil will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday, allowing him to nap in the afternoons. Getting into the swing of things: Keepers said when Kecil and Maggie were first put into their new enclosure, the older ape would wander too far ahead, and Kecil would get lost, but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another. She said: 'Initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people, and then there was a shift where he would turn to Maggie if he felt insecure. That was a big milestone. He really needs her to learn how to be an orangutan.' The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild. Kecil will be on display on Saturday and Sunday at Brookfield Zoo's Tropic World Asia enclosure between 10am and midday. The other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well. Hanging out:\u00a0The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild.

A midwife has won a decade-long battle to give mothers more time attached to their newborns before the umbilical cord is cut. Amanda Burleigh was convinced that clamping the cord within seconds of delivery \u2013 shutting off the blood supply from the placenta \u2013 was wrong. Since the 1950s, when doctors and midwives started giving women a hormonal injection to reduce the risk of haemorrhage, they have clamped the cord within seconds of birth. They feared the drug \u2013 since replaced with a safer substitute \u2013 could harm the baby. But Ms Burleigh, a midwife at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, believed it was unnatural to clamp the cord when it was still visibly pulsating with blood. She said: \u2018One day I had a brainwave and thought, \u201cWe all clamp the cord within seconds of the baby being born, but we are doing it without any evidence about whether it\u2019s good or bad for the baby.\u201d' She contacted other medics, including obstetrician Dr David Hutchon, and together the group amassed evidence that stopping the blood flow so early could be harmful. One study showed immediate cord-clamping could deprive a baby of a third of its blood stock \u2013 enough to fill a medium-size wine glass. In particular, they found the practice raised the risk of iron deficiency anaemia. A tenth of all toddlers are anaemic, which is linked to delays in learning, speaking and understanding. There is also growing evidence that immediate cord-clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies. They have finally succeeded in getting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to change its guidelines. NICE now states that doctors and midwives should not routinely clamp the cord \u2018earlier than one minute from the birth of the baby\u2019. The cord should be clamped within five minutes, but left longer if the mother requests. Besides the medical benefits, the change means mothers get the chance to hold their babies for a moment while still connected to them. Ms Burleigh, a midwife for 26 years, said she had to overcome persistent doubts from colleagues, who asked who she was to query medical protocol. \u2018There was quite a lot of resistance from both doctors and midwives,\u2019 she said. \u2018At times I felt like a whistleblower.\u2019 There is also growing evidence that immediate cord-clamping can be particularly harmful for premature babies. However, she said she felt a \u2018moral duty\u2019 to challenge a practice that was not grounded in evidence. Dr Hutchon, now retired, said hospitals had blindly clamped and cut within seconds of birth for decades. He said: \u2018We didn\u2019t notice we were doing any harm because we were doing it to every baby.\u2019 He became interested in 2003 after hearing that more premature babies survived when the cord was not cut early. But he said there was \u2018continual resistance to change\u2019 \u2013 with some doctors refusing delayed cord-clamping even today. Some still believed the theory that immediate clamping reduced the risk of mothers haemorrhaging, Dr Hutchon said, even though a 2013 study found it made no difference. Ms Burleigh, recently named Midwife of the Year by the British Journal Of Midwifery, added: \u2018In 20 or 30 years I think we will look back on immediate cord-clamping and think, \u201cWhat were we doing? We dropped an absolute clanger.\"' A spokesman for NICE said that its advice on care during childbirth was reviewed \u2018at regular intervals\u2019."], "reference": ["Amanda Burleigh was convinced clamping cord immediately was wrong.

Fourteen soldiers dispatched to restore order after a 2013 coup have been accused of abusing children as young as nine as they begged for something to eat, according\u00a0to a French judicial source. The investigation has been underway since last year but was only made public yesterday. The French president today said: 'If some soldiers have behaved badly, I will show no mercy.' President Francois Hollande has vowed to 'show no mercy' if French peacekeepers in Central African Republic are found guilty of raping hungry children in exchange for food. The French defence ministry has vehemently denied covering up the scandal following revelations it was made aware of the allegations in July last year when it received a leaked UN report on the subject. The ministry said it immediately launched a probe into the case when it received the news, sending investigators to the former French colony on August 1. A defence ministry spokesman urged 'great caution' because the accusations have not yet been proven, adding: 'There is no desire to hide anything. 'We are not hiding the facts, we are trying to verify the facts.' The abuse reportedly took place at a centre for displaced people near Bangui airport between December 2013  and June 2014. Paula Donovan, co-director of advocacy group AIDS-Free World, saw the report. A French soldier taking part in 'Operation Sangaris' stands guard  at the Boali church as people sit on the floor. She said: 'The children were saying that they were hungry and they thought that they could get some food from the soldiers. 'The answer was \"if you do this, then I will give you food\".' Of the six children testifying against the soldiers, four say they were direct victims of sexual abuse while two others witnessed it, the French judicial source revealed. The UN employee accused of the leak, Anders Kompass, turned the report over to French authorities because his bosses had failed to take action and has since been suspended, The Guardian reported. A UN spokesman confirmed  investigators had conducted a probe last year following 'serious allegations' of child abuse and sexual exploitation by French troops. French soldiers prepare to blow up captured weapons and explosive devices in Bangui on December 4, 2014. French soldiers patrol in a tank in Bangui amid dust as citizens go about their daily business. They added that an unnamed staff member had been suspended for leaking the report. Florent Geel, head of the Africa desk at the International Federation for Human Rights, said Kompass likely leaked the report because those accused are French. He said: 'When it involves Chad, there is never any follow-up. But here it involves France, where there is an independent judicial system, it could move things on.' The violence in the Central African Republic has largely pitted the Christian majority against mainly Muslim Seleka rebels who led the March 2013 coup against former leader Francois Bozize. The country has yet to react officially, but a government member who wished to remain anonymous said that if true, the allegations were 'horrible and unacceptable'.

Police went to a home on March 26 in Balch Springs to do a welfare check and were told by residents that a two-year-old child had died and a 'rising ceremony' was performed, according to\u00a0CBS. A report from earlier this month said that services took place at the residence on Duke Drive which also operated as Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey Church with services presided by Daniel and Aracely Meza (both pictured above) The ceremony held at the residence on Duke Drive was an attempt to resurrect the child, police claimed, and took place on March 22. Meza and her husband are pastors who presided over the church services held at the residence  and also lives there along with other families including that of the two-year-old boy, according to\u00a0WFAA.

In an earlier report, Lt Mark Maret told CBS: 'We don't know if this was to try and resurrect the spirit of the child and we don't know if this was to try and resurrect the child themselves or what exactly that service or ceremony encompasses.'

John Higgins plays a shot during his match against Robert Milkins during the Betfred World Championships. Milkins said of his conqueror: 'It's going to take a good man to beat him on that form.

A climber has set his sights on the summit of K2 - the second highest mountain in the world - 20 years after his mother died attempting the same feat. Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times\u00a0that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult \u2014 it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen.

When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb.

Analysis suggests there is up to 100billion barrels of the fossil fuel under the Home Counties. The potential goldmine in the Weald Basin, across Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire and Kent, could meet up to a third of Britain\u2019s oil demand within 15 years, according to the consortium exploring the area. Scroll down for video. UK Oil & Gas Investments say they have discovered 100billion barrels worth of oil reserves in the Weald Basin, near Gatwick airport (pictured, the well head at Horse Hill) A map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the Weald Basin, which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground. This could reduce reliance on oil from the Middle East and Russia and could be a major boost for British industry at a time when the North Sea supply is dwindling. But industry experts remained sceptical of the claims, with one describing them as \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. Since 1975, of an estimated 100billion barrels of oil in the UK North Sea, only 45billion have been pumped out. It is believed another 20billion barrels can be recovered before extraction becomes too difficult. Experts warned last night that only a fraction of the Weald Basin oil may be accessible for extraction. They also claimed fracking could be required to retrieve significant volumes. Stephen Sanderson, the chief executive of UKOG, said the site at Horse Hill was 'world class' and had the potential for 'significant daily oil production' at this proposed drilling site. Horse Hill Developments consortium made the discovery during test drilling in a well five miles from Gatwick Airport. UK Oil & Gas Investments, which has a 30 per cent stake, said \u2018cutting-edge\u2019 data suggested the oilfield holds 158million barrels per square mile \u2013 equating to 100billion barrels across the basin. At current crude prices, this could be worth \u00a33.7trillion. Stephen Sanderson of UKOG, which insisted it would not use fracking, said: \u2018By 2030, we could produce 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the UK\u2019s oil demand from within the Weald area.\u2019 Neil Ritson, of fellow consortium firm Solo Oil, said it was of \u2018major economic significance\u2019. If flow tests showed oil could be extracted, the production process could begin within 18 months, he added. US firm Nutech, which conducted the tests, estimated 3 per cent to 15 per cent of the oilfield could be extracted \u2013 up to 15billion barrels. UKOG chairman David Lenigas said drilling in the Weald could create \u2018many thousands\u2019 of jobs. Although the exploration site covered 55 square miles out of 1,100, he said the consortium was confident the entire region was oil-rich. Works: The well is situated in this container on the proposed drilling site. Exploration: Experts are now trying to work out how much of the oil will be properly recoverable. Mr Lenigas dismissed suggestions it would be hard to extract from the site, saying the ground was limestone which acted \u2018like a big sponge\u2019 and that \u2018you can effectively suck the oil out\u2019. The Australian entrepreneur, who lives in Monaco, is a director of 16 British companies \u2013 and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices. UKOG shares soared after the firm claimed to have discovered a \u2018world-class potential resource\u2019. However, Professor Alastair Fraser, of Imperial College London, said the claims were \u2018overly optimistic\u2019. A study by the university suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region, while the British Geological Survey estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil. Discovery: The Horse Hill site near Gatwick in Sussex, where a large amount of oil has apparently been found. Drilling: Exploratory wells have found that the ground contains 158million barrels per square mile. Development: The site is owned by a number of companies including UK Oil & Gas Investments. The professor added: \u2018The question will be how much of it we can actually get out and whether it is commercially and technologically viable to do so.\u2019 Malcolm Graham-Wood, of oil consultants HydroCarbon Capital, suggested residents might object to rows of onshore oil wells, adding: \u2018The question is can it produce oil? It is extremely difficult with a very low recovery rate. This is potentially interesting but I wouldn\u2019t attribute any value yet.\u2019 But Mr Lenigas said: \u2018To all those people who say I am hiking up the share price, I am not. I am just saying what the Nutech report says \u2026 I feel passionate that this is globally significant for Britain.\u2019 A Department of Energy & Climate Change spokesman said: \u2018The Government welcomes any new information which expands our understanding of the potential of the Weald Basin.\u2019 There might be 100billion barrels of oil beneath the Home Counties \u2013 but residents living above it may not receive a penny of the profits. The Government owns the land under your house \u2013 meaning homeowners have no right to any oil found beneath them. Once oil has been found, oil companies pay the Government for an annual licence which gives them the right to excavate the oil and keep the profits. The Government also gains money from the tax it receives on the oil extracted. The only way an oil company would pay the surface landowner is if it wanted to base its drilling site on their land. However, firms that undertake fracking, which is seen as a more intrusive and controversial method of extracting oil than simply drilling, must sometimes agree to provide \u2018community benefits\u2019. This could include building a playground or school nearby the fracking site, and is seen as compensation for residents. Oil companies need to consult communities if they plan to undertake fracking in their area, as well as gaining planning permission from the local council. Oil rush: The Weald Basin, of which Horse Hill is part, could contain a total of 100billion barrels. Mystery: It is not yet known how much of the area's oil will be easily recoverable.

The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA.

The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA. The BVA said it still supported badger culling to tackle tuberculosis in cattle. Animal welfare campaigners welcomed the news but said the BVA\u2019s ongoing support for cage-trapping and shooting was \u2018regrettable\u2019. It comes after the Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election. Addressing the National Farmers Union conference in February, Liz Truss said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years. The Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election. He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'. She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. 'It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.' She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife. 'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers. In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners. In Somerset, where the other pilot cull has been carried out, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785."], "reference": ["British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support of pilot culls.

A black police constable has won a race discrimination case against his force after they did not promote him due to the colour of his skin. Ronnie Lungu was singled out as 'a marked man' by Wiltshire Police solely due to his race, the employment tribunal ruled. It found the 40-year-old was passed over for promotion in favour of white colleagues after his internal assessments were secretly downgraded to make him appear unworthy. It also heard evidence that derogatory comments were made about Mr Lungu based on his colour violating his dignity. When the PC raised concerns with his superiors they were not taken seriously and his complaints were brushed off as trivial. The force - which has only 16 ethnic minority officers out of a total of just over 1,000 - had denied the claims. But the tribunal ruled that the Zimbabwe-born officer was unlawfully discriminated against on grounds of race. Mr Lungu said: 'When I realised I was being singled out and treated badly because of the colour of my skin I felt so angry and upset. 'I had worked all my career to serve the community and be the best police officer I could but I was being penalised because I was black. 'It was totally unacceptable. But what made matters worse was that when I did raise the issue internally it wasn't taken seriously.' The tribunal in Bristol was told that the father-of-three joined the force as a police constable in 2003 after moving to England and 10 years later was temporarily promoted to the role of sergeant. After passing his sergeant's exam he applied for the role permanently, but he was turned down. Employment judges were told he was the only black candidate out of 20 officers to go for the position. The panel found that his internal assessments were specifically downgraded in order to make him appear unworthy of promotion. It also was told that a senior member of staff were invited to make negative comments about PC Lungu during an appraisal. The tribunal concluded that Wiltshire Police had singled out Mr Lungu as a 'marked man' on grounds of his race. The judgment read: 'The reduction in the scoring has the very significant effect in terms of making it appear reasonable that the one black applicant for promotion was scoring lower than the 19 white applicants and should therefore not be promoted.' It went on: 'This behaviour is so extreme that the Tribunal cannot think of any apparent motive other than one that is directly related to [the] Claimant's race.' Despite his treatment, Mr. Lungu is still serving as a PC with the force. 'I joined the force to uphold the law and I still would like to remain with the force,' he said. 'I need reassurance from Wiltshire Police that they will take issues of discrimination seriously in future and I want to see new procedures put in place to tackle discrimination and better education among senior members of staff in how to deal with complaints.' Mr Lungu said he was left 'upset' and 'angry' after being penalised because he was black. His lawyer, Juliette Franklin, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'It's extremely disappointing that people are facing this sort of prejudice and discrimination. 'Wiltshire Police needs to take this tribunal ruling very seriously and take swift steps to address any failings which have been identified. 'The force needs to ensure that officers feel confident that if they experience racism or discrimination that any complaint will be taken seriously.'

'I have no doubt that this judgment will affect members of the Black and Ethnic Minority community who might be considering joining Wiltshire Police. 'I want to reassure the public that Wiltshire Police are committed to increasing diversity in the Force so that we can reflect the communities we serve. 'This case was complex and there were a number of points covered. With our legal advisors, we are undertaking an assessment of the Tribunal's findings in order to decide whether to appeal any aspects of the judgment. 'Following this assessment, decisions will be made on what action we may need to take and how we can ensure that lessons are learnt from this case.

The images, captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer Hugh Owen, have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to \u00a330,000. Everything from the waterfront, city centre and St Mary Redcliffe church can be seen in the shots, as well as\u00a0The Fourteen Stars Tavern building which was pulled down in 1857. It became part of the site for The Bristol Brewery Georges before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats. Many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today, particularly the area of High Street. Other shots are almost identical, including the one of St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist, which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the Second World War. The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. They are due to go up for auction in Cirencester tomorrow. Stepping back in time: The Fourteen Stars Tavern (pictured left) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down. It was replaced by The Bristol Brewery Georges, which has since closed and been converted into flats. As it is today (right) Many uses: There was a builder, undertaker and joiner stationed at\u00a0Broad Quay Bristol when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855. How Broad Quay Bristol looks now. It has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat. Little difference: The view through St John's Gate at the Church of St John the Baptist has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works. High Street in Bristol (left in 1850) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years. The structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former Norwich Union building. Today it stands defunct and boarded up (right) This fascinating picture shows Sleep Street in Bristol at the dawn of photography, believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855. St Mary Redcliffe church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years. Pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by Hugh Owen and, right, how it appears now. Hugh Owen's photograph shows St Peter's Hospital, which was\u00a0destroyed in the Bristol Blitz in 1940.\u00a0Built as a merchant's house, it had been a showcase of Jacobean architecture before it was bombed. Not much change: The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\u00a0Queen Elizabeth I is said to have described it as 'the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England' St Mary-Le-Port Street in Bristol.\u00a0The albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s. Area of beauty: College Green, Bristol, as it looked in the 19th century. A replica of the Bristol High Cross had been erected there, in the shadow of the cathedral, because the original was deemed too fragile to move again. Missing landmark: The remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1950 from College Green (pictured). Much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone. Another image of Sleep Street in Bristol.

The victory for the champions at Cordoba's El Arcangel stadium in balmy Andalucia lifted Atletico above Valencia and onto 62 points from 29 matches. Valencia have 60 points in fourth and can reclaim third spot with a win at home to sixth-placed Villarreal on Sunday.

Abby Swinfield, 18, a mother-of-one from\u00a0Castle Donington, in Derbyshire, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of March 30 after a house party in Tamworth where it is thought she took M-Cat.

Neighbours say ambulances arrived at this property at 1am. After arriving at hospital Miss Swinfield was put into a coma, but died a week later. Police are still waiting for the result of the post-mortem but it is believed the teenager had taken the illegal Class B drug Mephedrone - more commonly known as MCat or Meow Meow.

Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents.

Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday. In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. 'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan.

A \u00a35million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith.

Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing.

Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak. Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names. 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star.

Mayall, who played scheming Tory MP Alan B\u2019Stard in ITV series The New Statesman, and a host of other comedy characters, died suddenly aged 56 last June. But probate records reveal he had no will \u2013 even though he suffered serious head injuries and nearly died in a quad-bike accident in 1998 \u2013 which could mean complications for his wife of 29 years, Barbara, and their three adult children. Scroll down for video. Legacy: Rik Mayall is pictured in 1999 with his wife Barbara and their children after his quad bike accident. His estate could be liable for tax of tens of thousands of pounds which would not have been payable if he had left everything to his wife. Lawyers have always advised that people should have a valid will to avoid tax pitfalls. Mayall, one of the leading \u2018alternative\u2019 comics of the 1980s, surprised doctors by making a good recovery after his accident and returned to work in 1999, but he developed epilepsy and took daily medication. Rik Mayall (pictured) died suddenly aged 56 last June. His personal estate would be divided according to Government intestacy rules, which take into account marital status, children or surviving relatives. Andrew Kidd, a specialist probate solicitor and partner in London law firm Clintons, said that Mayall\u2019s children would be automatically entitled to a share of his net estate of \u00a31,192,701 after funeral and legal expenses, meaning they could inherit an amount liable for inheritance tax. But Mr Kidd said the amount of any tax payable would depend on the value of Mayall\u2019s chattels or personal belongings which would go to his wife under intestacy rules. Mr Kidd said that the rules for a married father like Mayall meant his wife would be due to receive \u00a3250,000 plus all his \u2018chattels\u2019, which would include any personally owned cars, furniture, ornaments, books and jewellery. By law, Mayall\u2019s children would then automatically get half the remaining value of the estate, creating a potential tax bill if the amount is more than the inheritance tax limit of \u00a3325,000. Mayall\u2019s widow would have received a life interest in the remaining half \u2013 meaning she could not touch or transfer that money but could claim interest on it. Mr Kidd added that Mayall\u2019s family could seek to avoid the tax by drawing up a deed of variation to split up his estate, reducing any sum left to the children so it was below the tax threshold. Mrs Mayall declined to discuss the estate and the apparent lack of a will.

He's the man behind the most roguish Tory MP of all \u2013 the arrogant, preening Alan B\u2019Stard, star of the hit television comedy The New Statesman. Yet writer Laurence Marks also played a crucial role in getting David Cameron into Downing Street, it can be revealed. In the 1990s, Mr Marks lived in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, where Mr Cameron would later become MP. He and his writing partner Maurice Gran had become local celebrities owing to the success of The New Statesman, which ran from 1987 to 1994. Roguish: Rik Mayall as Alan B'Stard in the comedy The New Statesman. David Cameron is pictured right. Although Marks was a committed Labour supporter and Gran was a Liberal Democrat, the then chairman of the local Conservative Association, Joyce Sanderson, sought their views on who should contest the seat for the Tories at the 1997 General Election. Against their advice, Witney Conservatives went for the one option the pair strongly advised against \u2013 Shaun Woodward. He would cause a political storm two years after being elected as an MP by defecting to Labour. So next time the seat came up for grabs, the opinions of Mr Marks and Mr Gran were clearly more respected. When they were introduced to all five on the shortlist to fight Witney at the 2001 Election, they plumped for an ambitious young man called David Cameron, who won the seat with a majority of nearly 8,000. \u2018When they selected Woodward, I told them, \u201cYou\u2019re making a dreadful mistake,\u201d said Mr Marks, 66, last night. \u2018Out of the five they introduced to us the next time around, David Cameron was by far the best. 'He was very bright and understood things but we never guessed he would be Prime Minister. Joyce knew my political views but she thought it was good to have an outside opinion. I\u2019m a member of the Labour Party but I admire certain Tories, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have created Alan B\u2019Stard. \u2018David Cameron is a lovely fellow \u2013 a really nice man. He used to come to my place for tea with his wife Samantha. We\u2019ve remained friends. I think the nation likes him. \u2018When he got into No 10, he sent us a lovely handwritten letter, saying, \u201cThank you so much, I wouldn\u2019t be here without you two.\u201d \u2019 Asked for his views on Ed Miliband, Mr Marks said: \u2018I don\u2019t know him. I don\u2019t think anybody knows him. He\u2019s an unknown quantity. If you vote for him, you\u2019re voting blind.\u2019"], "reference": ["The comedian, who died suddenly at 56 last year, failed to leave a valid will.

They carried duffel bags, plastic bags full of clothes and small suitcases. They'd already abandoned larger bags in a mound. Only carry-on luggage was allowed on this Air India plane. The passengers were mostly Indian nationals, plus Yemenis and people from other countries who had been working in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. They sprinted or walked with deliberation to the airplanes. The stress of living in a war zone showed on the passengers' faces. Nobody wanted to be left behind. They climbed the steps to the airliner and were greeted by the Air India crew, all wearing pressed uniforms, the flight attendants fully made up. After takeoff, the flight attendants went up and down the aisle offering drinks to the 188 evacuees as if they were on a vacation flight. But some passengers were already fast asleep, exhausted by the push to get out of Yemen, site of some of the most chaotic fighting in the Mideast. This scene has been repeated in recent days as countries work to get their citizens out of Sanaa during a small window when Saudi planes are not bombing the city in an attempt to drive out the Houthis, a Shiite group that has taken over the capital. Air India is especially active because so many Indian nationals work in other nations. Over the last few days, India has evacuated some 2,500 people from Yemen, said Gen. Vijay Kumar Singh, the Indian deputy foreign minister who's overseeing the evacuation. The flights are going to Djibouti, the small African nation nearly 430 kilometers (267 miles) away. Some evacuees are fleeing on boats at port cities such as Aden. People are leaving behind much more than luggage. Damodar Thakur, a professor at Sanaa University, lived in the capital 34 years and built a life there. He loved living in Yemen. \"I never felt like a foreigner,\" he said. Like the others, he was exhausted and jangled by the shelling and lack of electricity for long stretches. \"At night, my goodness!\" he said. \"Gunshots being fired every minute. Sometimes the sky full of sparkling lights. Some women crying, children terrified. Really bad.\" The Houthi rebels control Sanaa, including the airport. But the Saudis are bombing the city and thus control air access in a way, so getting people out requires coordination. The Saudi air force gave Air India a four-hour window to go to and from Sanaa and a specific travel route for a safe landing. As the plane approached the city, the crew could see the scars of the fighting. There were no cars on the roads. Dozens of buildings were destroyed. At the airport, the landing strips and airport terminal were untouched by Saudi bombs, but buildings on the outskirts of the airport and planes along the airstrip had been blown to bits. The loading of passengers was swift. They approached the planes carrying boarding passes -- another touch of normalcy in the otherwise abnormal event. They didn't  pay for the flight, though they had to purchase exit visas from the Houthis. Children sat on their parents' laps to maximize the number of people on the plane. Some passengers fell asleep as soon as they took their seats before takeoff. Everyone seemed to carry the weight of war, especially nurses who had tended the wounded. From Djibouti, the evacuees will most likely disperse to their home nations. \"Now I can only pray for Yemen and those we left behind,\" Thakur said."], "reference": ["Air India has evacuated 2,500 people in recent days from Yemen, Indian official says.

The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), are based on a study of about 95,000 young people. All those in the study had older siblings. Some of the elder children had autism and some did not. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Since autism can run in families, researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism. They found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk, whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed. 'Consistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk among privately insured children,' said the study, led by Anjali Jain, a doctor in Falls Church, Virginia. 'We also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD.' Autism is on the rise, and affects as many as one in 68 children in the United States, but its causes remain poorly understood. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield. He was later stripped of his medical license. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield that purported to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in 12 children. It was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted by the journal that published it. As the author, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. But concerns over vaccine safety, particularly in the Internet age, have proven difficult to quell. 'Although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD, parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with ASD,' said the JAMA study. 'Surveys of parents who have children with ASD suggest that many believe the MMR vaccine was a contributing cause.' Children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated, the study found. The MMR vaccination rate for the children with unaffected siblings was 92 percent by age five. In contrast, the MMR vaccination rates for children with older siblings with ASD was 86 percent by age five. An accompanying editorial by Bryan King, a doctor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, said the data is clear. 'The only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism,' King wrote. 'Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.'"], "reference": ["The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are based on a study of about 95,000 young people.

The suffering of Jalila - whose name has been changed - is just one of a number of harrowing accounts given by women who have escaped captured by the brutal Islamist organisation which is taking over swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq. The study undertaken by Human Rights Watch\u00a0found fighters were kidnapping women and children as young as eight, forcing them to marry and convert to Islam and raping them repeatedly \u2013 sometimes picking their victims\u2019 names out of a hand in a sick lottery. Scroll down for video. Yazidi women and girls have been separated from their families, forced to convert to Islam and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters, the study from Human Rights Watch says. Their actions amount to war crimes. it adds. Yazidi children as young as eight have been abducted from their homes in northern Iraq, raped by ISIS fighters and forced into marriage. One child interviewed said she was 'owned' and raped by seven different men. Of those who managed to escape, many feel suicidal after their traumatic ordeal and need better medical and psychological support, says Human Rights Watch. Some tried to kill themselves while in captivity to avoid rape. Their terrifying campaign of systematic rape was tantamount to war crimes - and possibly crimes against humanity, the report adds. Jalila,who managed to escape her tormentors, told the charity she was taken with seven members of her family when Arab men stormed her village north of Sinjar in August 2014. After a few weeks she was taken to a house in Syria that housed other abducted young Yazidi women and girls, where the men would come and select us. She was selected by an ISIS fighter, who slapped her and dragged her from the house when she resisted him. The names of Yazidi women were selected from a lottery for men to rape, a survivor told the charity. \u2018I told him not to touch me and begged him to let me go\u2019, she said. \u2018I was a young girl, and I asked him, \u2018What do you want from me?\u2019 He spent three days having sex with me.\u2019 During her captivity seven ISIS fighters \u2018owned\u2019 Jalila, and four raped her on multiple occasions. Human Rights Watch has collected the accounts of 20 women and girls who escaped from ISIS, which they say shows a system of organised rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery and forced marriage \u2013 acts that constitute war crimes. A 12-year-old girl (not pictured) told investigators she was raped for three days by a brutal Islamist militant. Another victim told Human Rights Watch how she had tried to kill herself so that she wouldn't be raped again. Rape and other forms of sexual violence committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war. These women were part of a group of 216 Yazidis who were recently released by ISIS after being captured last year. The survivors' stories come as United Nations (UN) investigators found evidence ISIS are committing genocide against the Yazidi minority in Iraq. The human rights office published a horrifying report in March describing killings, torture, rape, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers by the extremists. It suggested they may be guilty of 'war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide'. The report, based on interviews with more than 100 witnesses and survivors between June 2014 and February 2015, highlights brutal ISIS attacks on the Yazidis. The jihadists consistently separated out men and boys over the age of 14 to be executed, according to investigators. Younger boys were forced to become child soldiers and women and girls were abducted as the 'spoils of war'. Head of the investigation Suki Nagra said: 'These attacks were aimed at destroying the Yazidi as a group.' She added that ISIS was guilty of 'genocide' against the minority. Now they are urging that survivors get the medical and psychological treatment that they need to cope with the unimaginable trauma they suffered. Rashida told the charity she was told by her brother to commit suicide if she was unable to escape the ISIS fighters who had captured her. \u2018Later that day they made a lottery of our names and started to choose women by drawing out the names', the 31-year-old said. \u2018The man who selected me, Abu Ghufran, forced me to bathe but while I was in the bathroom I tried to kill myself. \u2018I had found some poison in the house, and took it with me to the bathroom. I knew it was toxic because of its smell. \u2018I distributed it to the rest of the girls and we each mixed some with water in the bathroom and drank it. None of us died but we all got sick.\u2019 Another woman, identified as Dilara, said she was taken to a wedding hall in Syria where ISIS fighters told the group to forget their relatives and prepare to marry them and bear their children. From 9:30am in the morning, men would come to buy girls to rape them. She told Human Rights Watch: 'I saw in front of my eyes ISIS soldiers pulling hair, beating girls, and slamming the heads of anyone who resisted. 'They were like animals\u2026. Once they took the girls out, they would rape them and bring them back to exchange for new girls. The girls\u2019 ages ranged from eight to 30 years\u2026 only 20 girls remained in the end.' Rape and other forms of sexual violence, sexual slavery, cruel treatment, and other abuses committed during an armed conflict violate the laws of war, the report by Human Rights Watch says \u2013 and better support is needed for children and women who survive such attacks. As well as a lack of provision for psycho-social treatment, there is a reluctance in the community to accept it, despite many women continuing to feel suicidal after their ordeal. 'Yazidi women and girls who escaped ISIS still face enormous challenges and continuing trauma from their experience,\u201d Liesl Gerntholtz, the women's rights director at Human Rights Watch said. 'They need urgent help and support to recover their health and move on with their lives.'"], "reference": ["Human Rights Watch report reveals suffering of Yazidi women and children.

She was left with life-threatening injuries to her torso, chest, arms and back. Joseph O'Riordan stabbed his wife of ten years Amanda (left) with a seven inch kitchen knife eight times. O'Riordan, who was a councillor at the time, rang an ambulance after the attack in October last year and admitted what he had done during the 999 call. Yesterday it emerged that four months later, while on remand, O'Riordan wrote to his wife from jail asking her to 'get my things together' before for his trial. Meanwhile Mrs O'Riordan, during questioning by her husband's defence team in court yesterday, sobbed: 'I did not want to hurt Joe. I never wanted to hurt him\u2026 even now. All of this is my fault because I had an affair.'

The couple, from Polegate, East Sussex, met in 1991 and had been married for ten years at the time of the attack, the court heard. Brighton Magistrates' Court heard that four months after attack, while on remand, O'Riordan wrote to his wife from jail asking her to 'get my things together' before for his trial. But Mrs O'Riordan said that last year she felt 'smothered' by her husband and wanted 'more me time.' This was the 'trigger' for her brief affair with postman Nicholas Gunn, who has since moved away from the area. 'It was not something I had ever done before,' she told the court. O'Riordan found out about the affair after hiring a private detective to follow her. He had also asked his friends to watch her. The jury heard that a row had developed between the pair on October 22 while they were visiting Mrs O'Riordan's mother after O'Riordan received a phone call, believed to be from Mr Gunn. Mrs O'Riordan said they then went to a KFC restaurant and in the car on the way home her husband became angry and she tried to get out, but was 'dragged' back and held down. Once the couple were home, she said her husband came into their bedroom brandishing a kitchen knife as he cried: 'You have made me do this. This is all your fault.' Mrs O'Riordan also said that just days before the assault her husband had talked of 'finishing her off and then himself'. She added: 'I just thought that was talk as it was not said in anger. I never read anything into it. It was not said with malice but it was said maybe a week before he attacked me.' O'Riordan was sitting on Polegate Town Council, East Sussex, at the time. He was also president of his local Royal British Legion and was invited to the Queen's garden party in 2013 for helping to arrange parts of her Diamond Jubilee celebrations. O'Riordan has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder. The trial continues.

Cardiff-based Proton Partners International Ltd, is to open the treatment centres, which will be available to NHS cancer patients, in Cardiff, London and Northumberland by 2017, with the first in the Welsh capital being operational by next year. The announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer Ashya told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in Prague. Scroll down for video. Five-year-old Ashya King, pictured in October, who suffered from brain cancer but has recently been given the all-clear after receiving proton beam therapy. Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy, which Ashya, pictured, received. Both Brett and Naghmeh King sparked an international manhunt last year after taking their son out of hospital in Southampton, without doctors' consent. Mr and Mrs King had wanted their son to have the cutting-edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain before travelling to the Czech Republic to the Proton Therapy Centre. Now, a group called Proton Partners International has now been formed in the UK following discussions between Professor Sir Chris Evans, the life sciences entrepreneur and UK life sciences and healthcare investors. They have committed almost \u00a3100million equity finance into the company. Professor Gordon McVie, senior consultant at the European Institute of Oncology, has been appointed chairman of the group, and Professor Karol Sikora has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company, alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts. Ashya, with his parents Brett and\u00a0Naghmeh. The Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. Professor McVie said: 'This is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the UK. As things stand, patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment, often at great expense to the NHS. 'The creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the UK.' While Sir Chris added: 'We are delighted that the UK's first centre will be based in Cardiff and Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund is proud to support this breakthrough. While conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells, often damaging surrounding tissue, proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour. Because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. While radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function, proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects. This means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas, such as brain cancer. However, Cancer Research UK estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known. The only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer NHS Foundation Trust in the Wirral, Merseyside, which delivers 'low energy' therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The NHS currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment. They must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment. More than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of \u00a3100,000 per patient. 'There are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the UK and the demand for treatment is growing. 'It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017. Proton Partners will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the UK as of next year.' In addition to state of the art Proton Partners' treatment services, the Cardiff centre will provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and supportive care. Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects. The Government has announced that it is to create two NHS proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. However, despite the treatment and his recovery, Ashya's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the UK, his grandmother said last month."], "reference": ["The three centres are planned for Cardiff, London and Northumberland.

Managers from the London Ambulance Service, the largest in the NHS, have just filled 225 vacant posts with applicants from Sydney and Melbourne. They were recruited on the back of a series of practical demonstrations on dummies, a written exam and an interview that lasted in all between four and six hours. Ambulance bosses are routinely making a 21,500-mile round trip to Australia to hire paramedics on \u00a34,500 \u2018golden hello\u2019 payments. The selection process, held at five-star hotels, was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job. It is the latest example of how the NHS is recruiting overseas because it has failed to train enough staff in Britain to meet the needs of the rising and ageing population. Hospital managers have been flying out to Spain and Portugal to hire batches of 30 nurses at a time. The ambulance service is also severely understaffed and, across England, around 1,250 posts are unfilled \u2013 a tenth of what is needed. The Mail attended a fast-track recruitment event last month at the five-star Sydney Harbour Marriott Hotel, overlooking the famous Opera House. Our investigation discovered how:. Growing numbers of paramedics are quitting the NHS. Many are frustrated at having to spend hours queuing outside A&E units which are too full to accept their patients. They are also being called out to a growing number of non-urgent calls from patients unable to see a GP. The selection process, held at five-star hotels, was so quick that by 8am the next day applicants had received an email informing them if they had a job. The increasing demand on ambulances means they are taking longer to reach the seriously ill. As a result, many paramedics are choosing to take up posts as \u2018advanced practitioners\u2019 in A&E, GP surgeries and call centres for the 111 helpline where the work is less stressful and they can earn more. London Ambulance Service has been the hardest hit by this exodus. Currently 340 posts are vacant, a fifth of the total workforce needed. Last year alone more than 230 paramedics quit. However, Australia has a surplus.Other understaffed ambulance services in the UK are also going abroad, including to Poland. As well as the 225 paramedics hired from Australia last month, London Ambulance Service hired 175 from there and New Zealand in September. Managers are considering flying out again later this year and calculate that the first recruitment drive saved the NHS \u00a39million. It costs \u00a350,000 to train one paramedic in Britain. Each trip to Australia costs the ambulance service \u00a390,000 in flights and hotel bills, but they return having hired on average 200 paramedics. They are offered a \u00a330,200 salary including London weighting. Jason Killens, director of operations at London Ambulance Service, said: \u2018It\u2019s not our long-term solution but is helping us fill a skills shortage while we train more people to become paramedics in the UK.\u2019 He said the paramedics had initially been filtered via an online form. Tim Jones is one of the many Australians being lured to Britain to work as a paramedic. He will join the London Ambulance Service when he finishes his degree course in October. The 22-year-old said it was \u2018exciting helping people\u2019, but also hopes it will enable him to see more of Europe.

But 11-month-old babies have already mastered the fundamentals of physics. Baby boys and girls were surprised when a ball seemed to disappear through a solid wall. Their curiosity did not end there. When they were then given the ball to play with, they repeatedly banged it on a table in an apparent attempt to work out its secret. Scroll down for video. Babies in the study reacted with surprise when objects like this toy car appeared to break the laws of gravity. The babies were similarly perplexed by a toy car that appeared to defy the laws of gravity and float in thin air. And given it to play with later, they repeatedly dropped it on the floor. Importantly, the babies shown the magic tricks were more interested in playing with the ball than a brand new toy that they had never seen before. Babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old. A study by psychologists at the University of Missouri\u00a0has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander. In an experiment with puppets they responded to different scenarios in a way that suggested they were more engaged than had been expected. The findings indicated the newborns had \u2018strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others\u2019, the researchers said. And they did better than others on a learning test, in which they had to link a specific sound to the ball. This, say the US researchers, suggests that babies learn from the unexpected, something that is important in a world in which we are constantly bombarded with information. Professor Lisa Feigenson, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: \u2018For young learners, the world is an incredibly complex place filled with dynamic stimuli. \u2018How do learners know what to focus on and what to learn more about and what to ignore? \u2018Our research suggests that infants use what they already know about the world to form predictions. \u2018When these predictions are shown to be wrong, infants use this as a special opportunity for learning. \u2018When babies are surprised, they learn much better, as though they are taking the occasion to try to figure something out about their world.\u2019 The professor studied 11-month-olds because they were old enough to sit and watch the ball and to pick it up and play with it. A ball was rolled down a slope and apparently passed through a solid wall in one magic trick in the study. Babies repeatedly droped the car after being shown the magic trick as they attempted to learn what happened. However, previous studies have shown that much younger babies and newborn animals have surprising amounts of knowledge about maths and physics, including whether an object should be able to pass through a solid wall. Writing in the journal Science, she said that some information may be so fundamental to survival that we are born with it. Lead author Aimee Stahl said that young babies are \u2018remarkably sophisticated thinkers\u2019. She added: \u2018It\u2019s easy to look at a baby and see a blank slate but actually babies have rich, sophisticated expectations about the world. \u2018Infants are not only equipped with core knowledge about fundamental aspects of the world but, from early in their lives, they harness this knowledge to empower new learning.\u2019 After seeing the ball trick babies would bang it on the table more as they attempted to uncover its secrets. The graphic above shows the reactions of the babies after seeing magic tricks that defied their expectations. The babies in the study were given choices about the toys they would play with after watching a magic trick. Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a study published last summer. Psychologists at King\u2019s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds who were identical ans non-identical twins. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later. The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14. The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores. Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, said: \u2018Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life. \u2018Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what\u2019s in our mind. 'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species\u2019 ability to store information and build a civilisation.\u2019"], "reference": ["Researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore showed babies magic tricks where balls seemed to pass through walls and toy cars floated on air. 11 month old infants were surprised when objects defied their expectations.

Scroll down for video. Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school. In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers. Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but they have not been named and their nationalities have not been revealed. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. 'I want to see them,' Muna Haji told The Washington Post. 'I want to know that these people are dead. They have killed innocent people.' Survivor\u00a0Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue today. She was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148.

People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa. This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre. Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen. Today survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued. The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a \u00a3145,000 bounty on his head. The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning today, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' al-Shabab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group.

'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation.

The Gunners are long-term admirers of Cech and are considering a move for the keeper ahead of next season. However, Arsenal will not be the only club interested in luring Cech when the transfer window reopens. Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain, Roma and Inter Milan are all showing an interest in the 32-year-old and Cech is understood to be keen on resolving his future as quickly as possible this summer. That means the Gunners could miss out on their primary goalkeeping target if they don't make an early move. However, there are some major obstacles Arsenal must overcome before landing Cech. The first is the goalkeeper's valuation. Despite the fact Cech enters the final year of his contract this summer, Chelsea will demand in excess of \u00a310million for the custodian. Thibaut Courtois has become Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper after three years on loan at Atletico Madrid. Chelsea's stance over their players joining rivals weakened with the sale of Juan Mata to Manchester United. The Blues believe Cech can play for at least another eight seasons and that his next club will be signing a world class goalkeeper in his prime. His price will reflect that view. Likewise, the Gunners may find that Chelsea are reluctant to sell them Cech. In recent years, the Blues have shown a hesitancy in selling players to their Premier League rivals, though that stance weakened last season with Juan Mata's exit to Manchester United. Cech and Courtois have spent a season sharing the gloves at Chelsea, but the veteran will now move on. Signing Cech would significantly strengthen the Gunners next season, and Chelsea could yet refuse to sell the keeper to their London rivals.

Frankie Dettori is to concentrate on the British flat season and not being picked to ride in France. The recruitment of Benoist could be seen as a snub for Dettori, who was replaced by Jarnet on Treve in the build-up to her Arc success.

It takes place at Dean\u2019s Blue Hole in the Bahamas, the deepest so-called \u2018blue hole\u2019 in the world with an underwater entrance. In order to stay alive, the brain is constantly telling the body to breathe. If you don\u2019t obey its primitive urges, carbon dioxide soon starts building up in the body, prompting an overwhelming desire to take a gulp of air. To fight that instinct, a competitive breath-holder has to work hard at expanding his lung capacity with a regular series of intensive breathing exercises. They practise \u2018static apnoea\u2019 once or twice a week, as well as \u2018dynamic apnoea\u2019 - holding breath while swimming - once in a while for fun, and also general fitness training.

However, N\u00e9ry revealed a few years ago that he didn\u2019t really reach the bottom of the hole - it\u2019s just filmed that way for artistic reasons. But the video is still incredibly impressive, as he holds his breath for minutes on end. Freediving is a form of underwater diving where no scuba gear or breathing apparatus is used. To breathe for minutes, free divers go through sophisticated mind-body control techniques to push self-induced apnoea - the science of not breathing - to the limits. Some free divers can hold their breath for more than 20 minutes. Stig Severinsen, for example - nicknamed The Man Who Doesn't Breathe - is the holder of multiple records in diving using his 'State of Zen' technique to control his breathing. In October 2012, Mr Severinsen broke the record for the longest time breath held voluntarily by a male by spending 22 minutes with his head submerged in a pool in London.

But for people who fly frequently, cosmic radiation can increase this exposure significantly. Now there is an app that records your personal radiation to reveal how much you are exposed to from from medical examinations, changes in your location, and flights. The TrackYourDose app (pictured) was developed by Germany-based firm esooka and uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists. The \u00a31.49 ($1.99) iOS app keeps a record of a user's personal radiation including exposure from changes in a person's location and flights. The TrackYourDose app was developed by Germany-based esooka. It uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists\u00a0from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Germany and the University Oulu, Finland. Since 1997, PTB has studied the cosmic radiation at typical flight altitudes and used this to calculate radiation levels. To to do this, PTB's scientists developed a carry-on 'flight case'. Using the case, PTB's scientists measured more than 2,500 points at flight altitudes between 5 miles (8km) and 7.5 miles (12km) worldwide between 1997 and 2006. This covered geographical location, the flight altitude and solar activity. 6 \u00b5Sv: Typical radiation from a dentist's X-ray. 10 \u03bcSv: Average daily natural radiation. 40 \u03bcSv: Radiation from flying from New York to Los Angeles. 100 \u00b5Sv: Radiation from a 10-hour flight across the North Atlantic. 2,100 \u00b5Sv: Annual radiation of a typical person in Europe. 3,000 \u03bcSv: Radiation from a mammogram. 3,600 \u03bcSv: Average annual radiation of a US citizen. 50,000 \u03bcSv: Maximum allowable yearly occupational dose in the US. 100,000 \u03bcSv: Lowest yearly dose linked to increased risk of cancer. 2,000,000 \u03bcSv: Severe and potentially fatal. It can measure all the relevant types of radiation, in particular neutron radiation produced in the atmosphere. Using the TrackYourDose app, users enter the details of the airports they are flying from and to and the date they are travelling. The current solar activity for the flight is then inputted, using a neutron monitor of the University of Oulu in Finland. In addition to tracking cosmic radiation from air travel, the app accounts for gamma radiation and cosmic radiation on the ground and medical examinations with ionizing radiation such as X-rays or CT scans lead to radiation exposure. The measurement is called the 'ambient dose equivalent' and is recorded in microsieverts (\u00b5Sv). In the US, this is often measured in a unit called rem and one sievert is equivalent to 100 rem. A ten-hour flight across the North Atlantic, for instance, results in a radiation exposure of between 50 \u00b5Sv to 100 \u00b5Sv. By comparison, an X-ray at a dentist exposes patients to 6 \u00b5Sv, depending on the type of X-ray. In 2012, the total annual radiation exposure of a typical person in Europe, through naturally occurring radiation, came to about 2,100 \u00b5Sv. The same year a radiation monitor tracked 131\u00b5Sv per hour at the site of the Fukushima power plant. While the average radiation of someone in the US is 3,600\u00b5Sv. Experts studied the cosmic radiation at flight altitudes between 5 miles (8km) and 7.5 miles (12km) worldwide between 1997 and 2006. A TrackYourDose user enters their flights details and solar activity for the flight is inputted, using a neutron monitor from the University of Oulu in Finland. A 10-hour flight over the North Atlantic, for instance, results in a radiation exposure of between 50 \u00b5Sv to 100 \u00b5Sv. By comparison, an X-ray (stock image right) exposes patients to 6\u00b5Sv - depending on the X-ray, while a mammogram (right) produces 3,000 \u03bcSv. A dosage of 2,000,000 \u03bcSv is considered severe and potentially fatal. Airline pilots are at risk of deadly skin cancer because they are exposed to cockpit radiation similar to levels from tanning beds. Pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed. And researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields, which can reflect UV radiation. A team from the University of California measured the amount of UV radiation in airplane cockpits during flights. The cockpit radiation was measured in the pilot seat of a general aviation turboprop airplane through the acrylic plastic windshield at ground level and at various heights above sea level. Sun exposures were measured in San Jose, California, and in Las Vegas around midday in April. They then compared them with measurements taken in tanning beds. While short-wave UV-B ultraviolet radiation cannot easily penetrate glass and plastic windows, long-wave UV-A is much more likely to get through. Both kinds of UV can cause skin ageing and cancer. Approximately half of this dose comes from X-rays, mammograms, CT scans and similar. The other, natural half occurs from radioactive compounds in soil and building materials like concrete and brick. The small amount of mineral potassium in the human body is also  radioactive. Of this natural radiation, around nine per cent comes from cosmic radiation. Particles from space interact with the atmosphere and Earth's magnetic field to generate cosmic radiation. Sources are said to include gamma ray bursts, solar flares and supernovae. It is what's known as ionising, which means particles can alter charged particles from atoms that can potentially cause chemical changes in body tissue. Exposure to this kind of radiation is more significant at higher latitudes and near the magnetic poles, and many planes take polar routes to cut journey times. This exposure is so significant that in 1994 US pilots and cabin crew were classified as 'radiation workers' and the maximum allowable yearly occupational does is 50,000 \u03bcSv. Last year researchers from the University of California found that pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed. And researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields, which can reflect UV radiation. The lowest yearly dose that has been linked to an increase in cancer risk is 100,000 \u03bcSv, while a dosage of 2,000,000 \u03bcSv is considered severe and potentially fatal."], "reference": ["The TrackYourDose app was developed by Germany-based firm esooka.

Blue Bell Ice Cream has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people. Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant the company's headquarters in Brenham, Texas. The now-recalled ice cream product - cups of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - is not sold in retail locations and is shipped in bulk to 'institutional accounts' such as hospitals in 23 states that comprise less than 5 per cent of the company's sales. 'We recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the company's Oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them,' the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Friday. Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant in Brenham, Texas, the company's headquarters. The recall, the first in the company's 108-year history, began when five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized at some point from December 2013 to January 2015. Officials determined at least four drank milkshakes that contained Blue Bell ice cream. Three of the patients later died. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, according to the CDC. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes. The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC also said Friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3-ounce cup ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of the six patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis, according to the CDC. The one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups, the CDC said. The 'investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,' the CDC said. Blue Bell said it will conduct a 'careful and complete examination' of its Oklahoma plant 'to determine the exact cause of the contamination.' The company says it voluntarily shut down the plant, then notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video. College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week. According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle. At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin. Early career: \u00a0Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident. Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series. Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down. Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it\u2019s not fun to live in this guy\u2019s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, \"What\u2019s the difference between you and Don?\" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I\u2019m not immune to that,. 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it\u2019s gotten worse year after year. It\u2019s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it\u2019s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona."], "reference": ["Mad Men star was charged with assault for November 1990 hazing incident.

It follows a provocative speech by Argentinian president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, prompting the Foreign Office to summon her ambassador for a dressing down. Buenos Aires responded by accusing three British oil firms of working without permission. The Argentine government said it was taking legal action against three British and two US companies for \u2018exploration activities for fossil fuels on the Argentine continental shelf without obtaining the corresponding authorisation\u2019. The legal complaint listed Rockhopper Exploration, Premier Oil, Falkland Oil and Gas Limited and US firms Noble Energy and Edison International \u2013 accusing them of sending a semi-submersible rig to explore a basin 120 miles north of the islands \u2018subjected to the illegitimate British occupation\u2019. Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (centre) poses with veterans of the 1982 Falklands War, during the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of the conflict last week. It also warned the rig\u2019s owner, Greece-based firm Ocean Rig, that it could face \u2018legal consequences\u2019 over the drilling. The diplomatic row over the fate of the Falklands has worsened in recent weeks, after the UK Government pledged to invest \u00a3180million in the islands\u2019 defences over the next ten years. President Fernandez de Kirchner last week promised: \u2018We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It\u2019s not just wishful thinking.\u2019 Her remarks came on the 33rd anniversary of Argentina\u2019s invasion of the Falklands, leading to a conflict that cost 250 British and 650 Argentinian lives. Last night Foreign Secretary Mr Hammond said: \u2018Cristina Kirchner\u2019s threats against those who do business with the Falkland Islands are as hollow as they are illegal. The islanders have a perfect right to develop their oil and gas industry \u2013 and they can rely on us to protect them from Argentinian bullying as they do so.\u2019 Alicia Castro, Argentine ambassador to the UK, was summoned by the Foreign Office on Wednesday. Yesterday, in a tit-for-tat move, Argentine deputy foreign minister Eduardo Zuain summoned the UK ambassador to Buenos Aires, John Freeman, to complain about recent spying revelations by Edward Snowden. Daniel Filmus, minister for the Malvinas \u2013 as Argentina calls the Falklands \u2013 said his government would try to block further oil exploration. \u2018We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,\u2019 he said, adding that this could involve \u2018an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters\u2019. Although Falkland residents overwhelmingly voted to stay British in a recent referendum, Buenos Aires claims the islands and surrounding waters belong to Argentina. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, pictured today, last month announced plans to boost the UK's military defences of the Falkland Islands. Last week, the Argentine president and ambassador Alicia Castro publicly attacked the UK Government's plan to boost defences on the South Atlantic islands. Mrs Kirchner's government has also suggested that British oil firms could be prosecuted if they start drilling in the waters around the islands without formal permission from Argentina. The outspoken Argentine president's latest comments came on April 2, the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1982 Falklands War. She reportedly said: 'International law and dialogue, not militarisation, are the path to a reunion and sovereignty. 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking.' But a Foreign Office spokesman attacked the provocative intervention. He said: 'The UK has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and surrounding maritime areas, nor about the Falkland Islanders' right to decide their own future. 'We object strongly to recent statements by the Argentine president and the Argentine ambassador to London and so summoned the ambassador to account for these.' It came after the British government last week dismissed the threat of prosecution against oil and gas firms working off the Falkland Islands. Three British firms - Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas - announced that they had found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands, which are claimed by Argentina. Last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the Government was preparing to 'beef up' defences in the Falklands. He said two Chinook helicopters and an upgraded surface-to-air missile system will be part of a new defence package for the islands. Mr Fallon said: 'We've been reviewing the defence of the Falklands, we do that every so often, and I'm going to be announcing to parliament later today how we are going to beef up the defences there, how we are going to modernise our defences, and to reassure the islanders that we are absolutely committed to their right to remain British and to the defence of the islands... 'We are absolutely committed to defending the Falklands. The threat to the Falklands has not gone away.' He said 'modernising what we are doing' in the Falklands was a response to the threat of Russia. 'Russia has changed. We hoped Russia would be a partner to us \u2013 a normal trading partner that respected the rules of the international system, but it's turned out that Russia is directly competing against and is becoming much more aggressive in lots of different parts of the world, and we have to respond to that.'"], "reference": ["Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said islands not British.

'As President and Commander in Chief, I firmly believe that the diplomatic option - a comprehensive, long-term deal like this - is by far the best option,' Obama said in his weekly address. Explaining that he expects a 'robust debate' on the deal in the United States, Obama said he will keep Congress apprised of the \"substance of the deal.\" Many of Obama's Republican opponents in Congress have been skeptical of a deal with Iran and suggested the US may be giving too much away in its negotiations. Echoing comments he made hours after the announcement of the agreement, Obama highlighted the rigorous inspections to which Tehran will be subject. 'If Iran cheats, the world will know it.

Rose's mother Barbara McGrath was just as heartbroken to hear the news and said even though her daughter is no longer getting cancer treatment, that her recovery will take some time. 'Even though she's now done with her treatments you still have a very long recovery process because you've basically just put two and a half years of poison into your body. You're not recovering overnight,' said Rose's mother, Barbara McGrath. Rose has been attending the Battle Creek Catholic Schools her whole entire life and when she was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia her world was turned upside down.

Now, researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke. The finding may explain why some spices, herbal teas and medicinal plants have high concentrations of nicotine in them, despite none being allowed in insecticides. Researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke (illustrated with a stock image) Nicotine was frequently used as an insecticide until it was banned by the European Union in 2009 because of its toxicity. But a surprisingly large number of food crops and plant-derived products still contain very high levels of nicotine. Dirk Selmar and his colleagues at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, set out to uncover whether there are reasons for this beyond the use of illegal insecticides. They used peppermint plants, which contain minimal traces of nicotine, in a series of mulching and fumigation experiments. He said: \u2018Tremendously elevated nicotine levels were detected after fumigation with cigarette smoke.\u2019 The researchers showed for the\u00a0that that peppermint plants (a stock image is shown) can take up high concentrations of nicotine from contaminated soils, as well as taking in the drug from smoke. Cats and dogs whose owners smoke are twice as likely to develop some types of cancer as those whose owners do not. Dogs that are exposed to tobacco smoke are much more likely to develop nose and lung cancers than dogs not exposed to smoke. Smaller pets and birds can also be affected as they are very sensitive to the effects of smoke. Previous research, by Tufts University, near Boston, US, also found that cats that live with smokers are twice as likely to develop Feline Lymphoma, a serious cancer of the blood and immune system. It is believed that when cats groom themselves they ingest contaminated dust, soot, ash and nicotine which was caught in their fur. They also showed for the first time that that peppermint plants can take up high concentrations of nicotine from contaminated soils. The team analysed plants in soil mulched with cigarette tobacco for more than nine days to find that the resulting nicotine concentrations in them were several times higher than the maximum residue level set by European authorities. The study, published in Springer\u2019s journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development, suggests that the reported high levels of this substance may indeed originate from tobacco. The researchers found a drastic decrease in nicotine concentration in plants as time progressed. This is likely because nicotine was taken up by the roots of the peppermint plants and processed in their leaves. \u2018Our results suggest that the widespread occurrence of nicotine in medicinal, spice and food plants may, at least in part, be due to other nicotine sources apart from the illegal use of insecticides,\u2019 Dr Selmar said. As well as being interesting to the food industry, the findings prove that substances such as alkaloids, can be transferred from one plant, after its death, to another.

He was being moved to the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center near Shirley today. Hernandez is being held separately from other prisoners and is on suicide watch. He is now equipped with green prison scrubs and his tattoos are being examined for gang affiliations. It can also be disclosed that he was hooked on 'angel dust', a drug known to cause users to experience violent outbursts and paranoia. The former New England Patriots star smoked the hallucination-inducing drug in marijuana cigarettes that are known as 'killer joints' in the world of drugs. Sources said the brute, found guilty of murdering Odin Lloyd, was using the dangerous drug for at least a year before the victim was shot dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS. The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Junction prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison. Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left).He will no longer be No 81 having been given his prison number: W106228. A man who knew Hernandez and asked not to be identified, said: 'He was regularly high or out of his mind on Angel Dust. 'People who were in his circles knew about it and we would talk about how it turned him into a punk. He was consistently aggressive, arrogant and unpleasant. 'His dope man would bring it to his house and he would roll it in with some weed and smoke it with his friends. 'He got so full of himself that he sometimes stopped caring if people saw him doing it and he would be told to go outside because restaurant owners were worried about their licenses. 'Some of my friends do security for high profile sports people and celebs and I was invited to a party by one. Hernandez was there and throwing his weight around. 'When I said 'Hi' to him, he looked me up and down like I was a piece of s***. 'He just ignored me like I shouldn't have been there. 'I guess he was a d**head before because all that fame and money went to his head. But the drugs made him turn out to be a monster. Few people liked him. They just went with everything to keep him under control.' Hernandez was a heavy drinker and would often down cocktails and champagne on nights out with his hangers on, picking up large bar bills and doing his best to impress women with his celebrity status. His jury heard that on the night of the murder he smoked marijuana and he was caught on camera dancing at a gas station while filling up his rental car after he smoked the drug. Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Moving day: Prison life is a far cry from Herandez cushy life in North Attleborough.

Angel dust is also known as PCP and is a white crystalline powder that can also be dissolved in alcoholic drinks. It is also available in a variety of tablets, capsules, and users snort the colored powders as well as insert them into reefers with hash or dope. Doctors say the effects are that users feel detached, distant, and estranged from their surroundings. They experience hallucinations, severe mood disorders, and amnesia and outbreaks of violent behavior. Experts say PCP is addictive and one of the long lasting effects can be that users become violent or suicidal. Angel dust has been called 'devil dust' by those who have seen the violent outbursts of users and the manner in which it transforms them. The US Department of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration says Angel Dust normally sells on the streets in powder, crystal, tablet, capsule, and liquid forms frpm $5 a tablet to $300 per ounce. Officials said users also referred to as Supergrass, Boat, Tic Tac, Zoom and, Shermans . Shayanna Jenkins, the mother of his two-year-old daughter, told the Lloyd murder trial that Hernandez smoked drugs on a daily basis. Hernandez showed signs of the effects with his brooding behavior in the months leading up to the Lloyd murder and is also accused in another murder case. Hernandez is charged in a 2012 double killing in Boston, accused in the drive-by shooting of two men he felt disrespected him at a nightclub. Victim: Odin Lloyd, who was murdered by Aaron Hernandez, resulting in the New England Patriots star receiving a whole-life sentence. Former Pats player Hernandez can be seen displaying his hip-hop moves as his rental car fills with gas, earlier that evening he had ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked marijuana. Having a high feeling of self worth is a classic symptom developed by users of the deadly drug. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder in the second case. He is charged with murdering Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after an encounter at the nightclub called Cure. Daniel de Abreu is said to have accidentally bumped into the footballer at a nightclub, spilling Hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was 'trying' him, and surveillance video outside the club showed Hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down. But he is accused of following them in a silver SUV and shooting them in their car at a stop light later that evening. The NFL waill now have to investigate how a heavy drug using sports star could have avoided rigorous testing designed to weed out drug cheats. They will have to consider whether the fallen star may have had a supply of masking agents which can be bought over the counter or he stayed clean long enough each summer to pass pre-season tests and then fell off the wagon without fear of being caught.

Current Premier League regulations require clubs to carry a minimum eight homegrown players, a group which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. Denayer falls into this category despite hailing from Belgium - making him all the more attractive to City next season. Pellegrini said: 'I think about the Academy, we must be patient. This club build all these things because young players are important. 'Maybe it's not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. 'I'm sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the Academy, they will be part of the squad. 'But it's important to be patient, important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it before.' Denayer would obviously fit the bill.

The BBC has been slammed for making a computer game simulating the terrifying ordeal Syrian refugees face as they try to flee their war-torn country.

Grim outcomes include being separated from your family by human traffickers, women being sold between militia groups, and refugees being beaten over the head and hurled into the Mediterranean from packed migrant ships.

Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes, who lost limbs in the   2013 marathon, today opposed the death penalty as a means of punishment for their attacker, urging others to 'overcome the impulse for vengeance.' The couple's statement of compassion follows a similar appeal made by the family of an eight-year-old boy, Martin Richard, who was killed in the blast. His seven-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. This week, after finding Tsaernaev guilty on all 30 counts related to the April 15, 2013, attack, a jury will decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or life in prison without parole. 'We must overcome the impulse for vengeance': Married couple Jessica Kensky and Patrick Downes have joined the appeals calling for Dzhokar Tsarnaev to be sentenced to life in prison rather than death. Emotional: The couple who lost a leg each in the blast said their position is highly emotional and practical. Moving on: Here they are pictured completing the Boston Marathon in wheelchairs on the one-year anniversary. In a statement to The Boston Globe, Kensky and Downes said: 'If there is anyone who deserves the ultimate punishment, it is the defendant. However, we must overcome the impulse for vengeance.' They call their position 'intensely emotional and profoundly practical.' The victims aren't the first to speak out against the death penalty in Tsarnaev's high-profile trial. The Boston Globe editorial board issued similar sentiments and last week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Tsarnaev should 'die in prison'. Like the Richards, Kensky and Downes call for life in prison without parole or appeals to ensure Tsarnaev 'disappears from our collective consciousness as soon as possible.' The Richards made their appeal in a moving op-ed for the Boston Globe, published last Tuesday, just a day after the two-year anniversary of their son Martin's death. While the Richards say they are thankful to the government prosecutors for their 'tireless and committed' work to bring justice, they are now asking them to drop the fight for execution and sign a plea deal to send the 21-year-old to jail for the rest of his life. No to execution: The family of bombing victim Martin Richard wrote an op-ed in the Boston Globe, saying they oppose the death penalty for terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The family is pictured on the two-year anniversary of the attack. Clockwise from top left: Denise Richard, Bill Richard, Henry Richard and Jane Richard. Moments before: Martin Richard is seen circled in blue on the day of the Marathon. Behind him walks Tsarnaev, carrying a backpack believed to have held one of the two bombs. Brothers: Tsarnaev's (right) defense attorneys have tried to paint him as secondary in a plot orchestrated by his extreme older brother Tamerlan (left). \u00a0Tamerlan died a few days after the bombing in a shootout with police. 'We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty, but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives,' the Richards wrote. 'We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering, painful reminder of what the defendant took from them, which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring.' They say sentencing Tsarnaev to death will only bring continued pain for themselves and the other hundreds of bombing victims. Victim: Martin Richard died at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. 'As long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours. 'The minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family,' they wrote. The Richards brought their three kids out to watch the Marathon two years ago, and were standing just steps away from where Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan (who died in a shootout with police a few days later) dropped off two pressure cooker bombs. Little Martin died in the blasts and his sister Jane lost a leg. During the course of Tsarnaev's trial, photos were shown in court of the moments before he dropped off a bomb in a backpack, strolling just behind the Richard family lined up against a gate at the finish line. On the day the op-ed was published, the Richard family revisited the finish line to take part in a memorial. The family were pictured hugging and crying at the emotional ceremony. The death penalty is outlawed in Massachusetts, where the trial is taking place, but since Tsarnaev is being judged in federal court, execution is still a sentencing option. However, experts say that the jurors may sway towards life in prison, considering the state's generally liberally view on the controversial issue. Tsarnaev's lead defense attorney is Judy Clarke, a woman who specializes in helping high-profile clients like the Unabomber escape the death penalty. Clarke and the rest of Tsarnaev's legal team have been trying to paint their client as a gullible young man who was a secondary player in her older brother's terrorist plot.

Hamdi Ulukaya was once a Turkish immigrant with dreams of making it big in the U.S. food industry. His American-born ex,\u00a0Dr. Ayse Giray, sued him in 2012 on claims her family lent him $500,000 that helped make his dreams a reality.

The settlement came just before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla was due to rule on whether Giray could retroactively be named a shareholder in Chobani's predecessor company, a feta cheese operation called Euphrates. Giray first sued Ulukaya in 2012 for a 53 percent stake in the company. The two were married just two years in the 1990s and Ulukaya's company was not an issue in their divorce, according to the New York Post. Yogurt boom: Giray first sued Ulukaya in 2012 for a 53 percent stake in the company. The two were married just two years in the 1990s and Ulukaya's company was not an issue in their divorce. However, in early 2015, court documents revealed that Giray was basing at least part of her claim on scribbled handwritten notes her lawyers were 'confirmation that monies were provided.' Ulukaya wrote the notes off as mere 'family expenses.' Nonetheless, his camp settled rather than leave themselves open to losing assets worth $1 billion to Giray. But even with this suit behind him, Ulukaya still has business problems ahead of him. Since early this year, Chobani has been considering replacing him as CEO, the\u00a0New York Post reported, citing people familiar with the matter. One of the primary reasons for the removal of Ulukaya, who founded the company, is a product recall in 2013 that led to negative EBITDA of $87 million in the fourth quarter, the paper reported, citing internal documents it reviewed. The recall was a result of bad design and layout incorporated during the construction of the company's $450 million Idaho factory, and due to lack of training for workers, the Post reported. Ulukaya, who built the factory, kept a lot of his key executives in the dark as they continued to spend freely amid mounting losses and increasing chaos at the factory, the report said. Private-equity firm TPG invested $750 million in the New Berlin, New York-based company last year to save it from the cash crunch arising as a result of the problems at Idaho.

Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday afternoon. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing. A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the incident to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming: \u00a0'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Scroll down for video. Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon. Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf. Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' Ms Eden was not having a bar of it.\u00a0'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady?\u00a0What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand. 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent.\u00a0'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport. Ms Eden told Daily Mail Australia the couple alighted the train at Sydney International Airport.

'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. 'I missed my stop because I wanted to stay on and make sure they were OK,' said Ms Eden, who was on her way home to Mascot. Ms Eden said the woman was saying 'horrible and hurtful things'. 'She told me if I was in their country I would have been stoned to death because I was wearing a dress. 'She was saying a lot of things I just got to the point where I had heard enough.' The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said. A hijab-wearing woman told the ABC last month she was subject to a physical and verbal assault on a Sydney train, with a man allegedly shoulder-charging her and hitting her with his bag and leg.

'It was a fully crowded train but nobody said anything. People were just listening. I know they were scared,' Hina said. As for Ms Eden, she told Daily Mail Australia she was already overwhelmed by positive comments she had received online, having posted the video just yesterday. 'Good on you for sticking up for whats right more people should be doing the same,' wrote punter Rachel Lambert. 'Well I don't know you but thank you, thank you for understanding,' said\u00a0Shahiq Sarkar. Overwhelming response: Ms Eden has been bombarded with positive comments since the video appeared online.

Ursula Ward, the mother of Odin Lloyd, wants to look Hernandez\u00a0in the eye when he testifies during the\u00a0wrongful death suit. according to attorney\u00a0Doug Sheff. Hernandez, who did not testify at his criminal trial and had a $40million contract, was convicted April 15 of first-degree murder for killing Lloyd on June 17, 2013. Scroll down for video.

Ward said during a press conference on Wednesday: 'The day I learned my son was shot and killed, I thought my life ended with his. 'I always wished I was there to take those bullets for Odin.' She did not address or take questions about the lawsuit but focused her comments on her love for her son. 'Odin was loved by many,' she said. 'Odin will be missed tremendously.' Sheff said it was possible he would call Patriots officials, including owner Bob Kraft, to testify if he thought their testimony would be 'relevant',\u00a0according to the\u00a0Boston Herald. He said: 'We will also call different witnesses in the civil case, including Mr Aaron Hernandez. 'When we do he will no longer be able to hide behind any sort of Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination because he is already convicted of the crime. 'No one wants to unnecessarily disturb any professional or anybody, but if it is important and it is part of zealously representing our client, then we will do what we have to.' Wealthy: Hernandez (No. 81) had already been paid more than $9.2million of his $40million deal at the time of the murder. Pain and relief: Ward seen reacting to the guilty verdict for  Hernandez after his trial at Bristol County Superior Court in April. The team was originally named in the suit, but the organization was dismissed after agreeing any money released to Hernandez would be granted to the Lloyd family,\u00a0Boston.com\u00a0reported. The Patriots terminated their contract with Hernandez shortly after he was charged and team lawyers have said New England does not owe the 25-year-old 'another penny'. He had already been paid more than $9.2million of his $40million deal and the NFL Players Association filed a grievance on his behalf seeking in additional $6.2million in guaranteed money. They are awaiting the outcome of the grievance said\u00a0Donald Grady, another of Ward's lawyers. The Patriots and Ward's lawyers have agreed that if it is determined the team owes him more money, it will not pay Hernandez but will instead hold onto the money and alert them and the court. The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed in December 2013 but was put on hold during the criminal trial. While an appeal is automatic in the criminal case, Sheff said he plans to file papers in the next few weeks to resume the lawsuit so he can hunt down Hernandez's assets. One asset they do know about is his home in North Attleborough, which is assessed at $1.2million. Hernandez's fiancee and two-year-old daughter live there.

He said Lloyd's family isn't in it for the money because no amount can compensate for their loss. Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Hernandez picked him up and drove him to an industrial park near his home, where Lloyd was shot six times. Hernandez's lawyer, John Fitzpatrick, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

{"question_id": 318, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Britain struck oil in the Falklands yesterday, a discovery likely to escalate already heightened tensions with Argentina over the ownership of the islands. Above, troops walk across the island in 1982. Argentina has said it will prosecute oil companies operating off the Falklands coast, as tension rise on the 33rd anniversary of the conflict. Officials claim companies active there are acting 'illegally' in Argentine territory. It comes after Britain struck oil in the Falklands this week in a remote field of the islands. The find, announced by British firms that share the exploration area (Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas), could be worth billions of pounds and will increase fears of renewed conflict over the British overseas territory. It comes just days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned of a 'very live threat' from Argentina. David Filmus, the Argentine minister in charge of the Malvinas, as the islands are known in Latin America, said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk.' He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,' Mr Filmus said, adding that the process 'could end with an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters'. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. 'The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,' he added. 'The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, 'We should have it'. 'We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest \u00a3180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile. A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well. Yesterday's discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: 'This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.' Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: 'This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.' Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: 'Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically \u2013 look at Alaska, for instance \u2013 but that has never worried the oil industry.' Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was 'an excellent start to the exploration campaign'. War veterans sing the national anthem and hold the Argentinian flag during a ceremony marking the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week. Kirchner\u00a0used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands. Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' Documents released by American whistleblower Edward Snowden allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is 'encouraging news', but another well \u2013 called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south \u2013 is the 'most important' in the area. Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in 'ageing infrastructure' and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system. It came after news that Russian president Vladimir Putin was reportedly working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 bombers to Argentina.
