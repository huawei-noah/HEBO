Introduction
============

Welcome to the Agent Framework documentation. This framework integrates advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and OpenChat, providing a versatile environment for developing applications with sophisticated natural language processing, reasoning, and communication capabilities.


Purpose
-------

The framework is designed to facilitate the development of applications that leverage the power of LLMs. Its primary goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface for switching between various prompting methods and supporting fair testing environments across different LLMs.


Key Features
------------

- **Integration with Multiple LLMs:** Agent supports various models like GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and OpenChat, allowing for flexible application development.

- **Versatile Prompting Methods:** The framework enables easy switching between different prompting methods, catering to a wide range of use cases.

- **Comprehensive Configuration Management:** Using Hydra, Agent offers a robust configuration system, simplifying the management of different settings and environments.

- **Advanced Memory Management:** The framework includes sophisticated memory handling, enabling more complex reasoning and decision-making capabilities.

- **Tool Integration:** The framework includes various tools for tasks such as code interpretation, providing a comprehensive environment for application development.

- **Several Testing Environments:** Agent supports multiple testing environments, with the ability to easily extend to more environments.
