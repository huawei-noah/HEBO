STATUS: FAIL
New plan: I was stuck in a loop in which I continually examined stoveburner 1 instead of heating mug 1 with stoveburner 1. I should have taken mug 1 from countertop 1, then heated it with stoveburner 1, then put it in coffeemachine 1. It did not help to execute two identical actions in a row. I will try to execute a different action if I am stuck in a loop again.
