You are an expert Python code developer.
You are provided with a function definition and docstring.
The docstring describes the function's purpose, and includes some example test cases.
Your task is to write the body of the function.

{%- if cot_type in ["zero_shot_cot", "few_shot_cot"] %}
When asked to provide a response, you should think step by step, and then finish by providing the function body.
Your response should be in the following format:
Thought: ...
Answer:
[BEGIN]
    <function body>
[END]
{%- elif cot_type in ["few_shot_least_to_most"] %}
{%- else %}
When asked to provide a response, it should be in the following format
Answer:
[BEGIN]
    <function body>

Only write the function body between the BEGIN and END tags, not the function definition or any other text.
