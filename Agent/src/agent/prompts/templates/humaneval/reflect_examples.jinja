You are attempting to complete a coding function.

Prompt:
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

Answer:
[BEGIN]
    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance > threshold:
                    return True

    return False
[END]

Observation: Are you sure about this answer? Please reflect carefully and be sure of your final answer.

Reflection: Upon reflecting, I realised that distance should be less than the threshold in line 5.
Answer:
[BEGIN]

        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
            if idx != idx2:
                distance = abs(elem - elem2)
                if distance < threshold:

Status: PASS

Prompt:
from typing import List


def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """ For a given number n, find the largest
    number smaller than n that divides n evenly
    >>> largest_divisor(15)
    5

Answer:
[BEGIN]
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0:
    return i
[END]

Observation: Are you sure about this answer? Please reflect carefully and be sure of your final answer.

Reflection: Upon reflecting, I realised that there is an indentation error and return should be inside the if statement.
Answer:
[BEGIN]
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
[END]

Status: PASS
