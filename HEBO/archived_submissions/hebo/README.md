Bayesian optimisation library

## Features to support

- Basic Bayesian optimisation
- Mainstream acquisition functions
- Constrained Bayesian optimisation (weighted EI, Thompson sampling, entropy search) 
- Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation
- Multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation
- Safe Bayesian optimisation
- High-dimensional Bayesian optimisation
- Batch optimisation
- Meta learning (learn from past optimisation tasks or relavent data)
- Prior embedding
- Support other probablistic models:
    - BNN via variational inference
    - BNN via SGDMCMC
    - Deep ensemble

## TODO

Everything (+_+)
