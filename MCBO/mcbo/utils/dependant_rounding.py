""" :func:`DepRound`: implementation of the dependent rounding procedure, from [[Dependent rounding and its applications to approximation algorithms, by R Gandhi, S Khuller, S Parthasarathy, Journal of the ACM, 2006](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1147956)].
It solves the problem of efficiently selecting a set of :math:`k` distinct actions from :math:`\{1,\dots,K\}`, while satisfying the condition that each action :math:`i` is selected with probability :math:`p_i` exactly.
The distribution :math:`(p_1, \dots, p_K)` on :math:`\{1,\dots,K\}` is assumed to be given.
Dependent rounding developed by [Gandhi et al.] is a kind of technique that randomly selects a set of edges from a bipartite graph under some cardinality constraints.

- It runs in :math:`\mathcal{O}(K)` space complexity, and at most :math:`\mathcal{O}(K^2)` time complexity (note that the article [Uchiya et al., 2010] wrongly claim it is in :math:`\mathcal{O}(K)`).

    is a very clean presentation of the algorithm.

    Args:
        weights_p:  :math:`k < K` and weights_p :math:`= (p_1, \dots, p_K)`
                    such that :math:`\sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i = k` (or :math:`= 1`).

    Returns:
        A subset of :math:`\{1,\dots,K\}` with exactly :math:`k` elements.
        Each action :math:`i` is selected with probability exactly :math:`p_i`.

    Example:

    >>> import numpy as np; import random
    >>> np.random.seed(0); random.seed(0)  # for reproductibility!
    >>> K = 5
    >>> k = 2

    >>> DepRound(weights_p, k)
