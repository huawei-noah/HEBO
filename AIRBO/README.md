Welcome to the repository for our paper: [Efficient Robust Bayesian Optimization for Arbitrary Uncertain Inputs, NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20145). 

## Overview

Bayesian optimization is a powerful framework for global optimization of expensive black-box functions. However, most existing methods assume that the inputs are perfectly known and fixed, which is often not the case in real-world applications. In AIRBO, we propose a novel method for efficient robust Bayesian optimization that can handle arbitrary input uncertainties. In particular, we design an MMD-based kernel to measure uncertain inputs in an RKHS and employ Nystrom approximation to boost the inference of GP posterior.

## Features

- Can take random variables (*e.g.*, input with noise)  as inputs and propagate the input uncertainty to the posterior.
- Can be applied to arbitrary input distribution if we can sample from it.
- Aim to find a robust optimum whose expected function value is best under the input uncertainty. 
- Efficient posterior inference (40 times more efficient than the integral kernel).


## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher

- Botorch 0.9.2 or higher

- GPytorch 1.11 or higher
