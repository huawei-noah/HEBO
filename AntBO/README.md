# AntBO 

**A combinatorial Bayesian Optimisation framework enabling efficient in
silico design of the CDRH3 region.**

![AntBO overview](./figures/AntBO_illustrationPNG.PNG?raw=true)

This repo provides the official implementation of _AntBO_,
as well as all the code needed to reproduce the experiments presented in
[AntBO: Towards Real-World Automated Antibody Design with Combinatorial Bayesian Optimisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667237522002764).


## Setup
The code has been tested on  `Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS` with `python 3.9.7` 

#### Conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml 
conda activate DGM
```

#### Antigen simulator: _Absolut!_

Install [Absolut!](https://github.com/csi-greifflab/Absolut) by following instructions 
of their README: https://github.com/csi-greifflab/Absolut#installation. 

#### Install all pre-computed structures (~33GB)

```bash
PATH_TO_ABSOLUT=./Absolut # put the path of the directory where Absolut! is installed
cd $PATH_TO_ABSOLUT
aria2c -i ../urls.txt --auto-file-renaming=false --continue=true
```

## Demo

To run AntBO (as well as other baselines, Genetic Algorithm, 
and Random Search), the user needs to specify a `config.yaml` file containing the parameters of the run ([a default 
config file](./bo/config.yaml) is also provided).

Given a config file, AntBO can be run using the following command line:
```shell
 python ./bo/main.py --config ./bo/config.yaml --n_trials 5 --seed 42 --antigens_file ./dataloader/core_antigens.txt 
```
- Using `--n_trials 5` and `--seed 42` implies that the optimisation will be run over 5 random seeds starting from 
seed 42.
- `--antigens_file ./dataloader/core_antigens.txt` indicates that **AntBO** will be run on each of
 the antigens listed in the file [./dataloader/core_antigens.txt](./dataloader/core_antigens.txt).
- The results will be stored in the folder specified in the `config.yaml` file (under the `save_dir` field).

#### Results visualisation
To plot the regret curve associated to one run of **AntBO** on an antigen, one can either run the following:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from utilities.misc_utils import load_w_pickle
from typing import *

from bo.main import BOExperiments
from task.utils import plot_mean_std

# --- Select for which antigen you want to plot the regret curve --- #
antigen_name = ...

# --- These must match your config.yaml --- #
save_path: str = ... 
kernel_type = "transformed_overlap"  
cdr_constraints = 1
seq_len: int = 11
search_strategy = "local"

init_seed = 42
n_trials = 5

# ----------- Collect evolution of scores for each seed ----------- #

results = []
for seed in range(init_seed, init_seed + n_trials):
    
    result_path_root = BOExperiments.get_path(
        save_path=save_path,
        antigen=antigen_name,
        kernel_type=kernel_type, 
        seed=seed,
        cdr_constraints=cdr_constraints,
        seq_len=seq_len,
        search_strategy=search_strategy,
    )

    result_path = os.path.join(result_path_root, 'results.csv')

    if not os.path.exists(result_path):
        continue

    data = pd.read_csv(result_path).BestValue.values
    
    results.append(data)

# --------------------- Plot the regret curve --------------------- #

ax = plot_mean_std(results)
ax.set_xlabel("Num. evaluations", fontsize=16)
```

or rely on the [convergence curve plotting script](./visualise_results/plot_convergence_curve.py) fed with a 
[configuration file](visualise_results/convergence_curve_config.yaml).

```shell 
python ./visualise_results/plot_convergence_curve.py --config ./visualise_results/convergence_curve_config.yaml
```

abstract = {Summary
Antibodies are multimeric proteins capable of highly specific molecular recognition. The complementarity determining region 3 of the antibody variable heavy chain (CDRH3) often dominates antigen-binding specificity. Hence, it is a priority to design optimal antigen-specific CDRH3 to develop therapeutic antibodies. The combinatorial structure of CDRH3 sequences makes it impossible to query binding-affinity oracles exhaustively. Moreover, antibodies are expected to have high target specificity and developability. Here, we present AntBO, a combinatorial Bayesian optimization framework utilizing a CDRH3 trust region for an in silico design of antibodies with favorable developability scores. The in silico experiments on 159 antigens demonstrate that AntBO is a step toward practically viable in vitro antibody design. In under 200 calls to the oracle, AntBO suggests antibodies outperforming the best binding sequence from 6.9 million experimentally obtained CDRH3s. Additionally, AntBO finds very-high-affinity CDRH3 in only 38 protein designs while requiring no domain knowledge.}
